# Description: Blackjack is a game that is played using cards.
# The gaol of the game is to add up the cars to the largest number without going over twenty-one.
# If the cards in the hand add up more than twenty-one then its called a bust.
# Meaning the game is lost imidiatly. It doesent matter how much the user goes over twenty one then the user looses.
# The way the cards are counted are that all the cards from 2 - 10 are counted as their face value.
# The Jack, Queen, and King cards count as ten. The Ace card can count as 1 to the total or can count as 11.
# Depending if the user went over 21 or under the user can decide the value of the Ace.

# TODO Deal both user and computer a starting hand of 2 random card values.
# TODO Detect when computer or user has a blackjack. (Ace + 10 value card).
# TODO If computer gets blackjack, then the user loses (even if the user also has a blackjack).
# If the user gets a blackjack, then they win (unless the computer also has a blackjack).
# TODO Calculate the user's and computer's scores based on their card values.
# TODO If an ace is drawn, count it as 11. But if the total goes over 21, count the ace as 1 instead.
# TODO Reveal computer's first card to the user.
# TODO Game ends immediately when user score goes over 21 or if the user or computer gets a blackjack.
# TODO Ask the user if they want to get another card.
# TODO Once the user is done and no longer wants to draw any more cards, let the computer play.
# The computer should keep drawing cards unless their score goes over 16
# TODO Compare user and computer scores and see if it's a win, loss, or draw.
# TODO Print out the player's and computer's final hand and their scores at the end of the game.
# TODO After the game ends, ask the user if they'd like to play again. Clear the console for a fresh start.
